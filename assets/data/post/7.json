gf.\r\nHowever, since the COVID-19 pandemic,\r\nwe have not been able to go to trip for about two years, but recently,\r\nregulations on travel have been eased a lot and the risk of coronavirus has been lowered,\r\nso we went on a trip to <u>Jeju Island</u>, one of Korea's most beautiful travel destinations.\r\n\r\n# Why Jeju Island?\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, Jeju Island is one of Korea's most beautiful travel destinations.\r\nAnd it is also the place where my gf wanted to go for a long time.\r\nBut the reason we couldn't go was because neither I nor my girlfriend knew how to drive.\r\nBecause Jeju Island is big, we thought we could only travel by renting a car and driving.\r\n\r\nWe still don't know how to drive.\r\nHowever, we decided to go on a trip boldly, believing in taxis and buses.\r\nAnd this trip was very successful.\r\n\r\n# Day 1\r\n\r\n## Depart to Jeju Island\r\n\r\nIt was the day we left for Jeju Island.\r\nWe headed to Jeju Island from <u>Sacheon Airport</u> by an airline called Hi-Air.\r\nHi-Air was the only airline from Sacheon to Jeju Island.\r\nIt was a low-cost airline.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/posts/7/KakaoTalk_20220501_131246877.jpg \"Airplane to Jeju Island\")\r\n\r\nCan you see that cute, green airplane?\r\nIt also had propellers on its wings.\r\nIt was our first flight since we became adults, so we were very excited.\r\nThe sound of the plane's engine and the blue sky from the window made us realize that we were going on a trip to Jeju Island.\r\n\r\n## Arrived at Jeju Island\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/posts/7/KakaoTalk_20220501_131246877_02.jpg \"Jeju Island Airport\")\r\n\r\nWe flew for an hour and arrived at Jeju Island.\r\nWe took a lot of pictures on the plane, but we couldn't get a good one.\r\nInstead, there are pictures taken on the return flight, so please look forward to it.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/posts/7/img.png \"All buses moved only in one direction\")\r\n\r\nWe didn't know what the airport looked like because we had never been to it.\r\nJeju International Airport, as you can see in the picture,\r\nall buses moved only in one direction.\r\nBuses with the same number but different directions passed.\r\nTherefore, you should check not only the bus number but also the bus stop you need to take.\r\n\r\nWe were able to avoid taking the wrong bus with the help of a local.\r\n\r\n## The first lodging, Urbanstay\r\n\r\n<div class=\"google-map\">\r\n  <a\r\n    target=\"_blank\"\r\n

dinner was Bracken Yukgaejang from <u>Ujin Haejangguk</u>, which is only found in Jeju Island.\r\nIt's a place where you have to wait an hour or more if you are unlucky,\r\nbut fortunately we were able to eat as soon as we arrived at the restaurant.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"slide-images\">\r\n  <a\r\n    target=\"_blank\"\r\n    class=\"image-link\"\r\n    rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"\r\n

I didn't feel the spicy taste of Yukgaejang.\r\nThis was enough for a dinner, but if you have to wait more than an hour to eat it, consider something else.\r\nIt wasn't worth it.\r\n\r\n## Night

</div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThere is a night market in Dongmun Market in Jeju Island.\r\nIt is open from 19:00 to 24:00 in May to October and from 18:00 to 24:00 in November to April.\r\n\r\nWhen we visited, there were so many people that there was no space to step on.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/posts/7/KakaoTalk_20220501_131246877_07.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe night market was small.\r\nI have visited the Vietnamese night market before, and it was quite disappointing compared to that.\r\n\r\nStill, there are many things to eat, so it's not bad to visit at least once.\r\n\r\n# Day 2\r\n\r\nThe schedule for this day was the busiest, but I was most satisfied.\r\nWe got up early in the morning and moved for a meal.\r\n\r\n## Ollae Guksu\r\n\r\n<div class=\"google-map\">\r\n  <a\r\n

restaurant that sells Gogi Guksu(Meat noodles), a local food of Jeju Island,\r\nand it has a different charm from Japanese Chashu Ramen, which has meat.\r\nIf you have tried Korean pork and rice soup, you can feel a similar impression in Gogi Guksu.\r\n\r\n<div class=\"slide-images\">\r\n  <a\r\n    target=\"_blank\"\r\n    class=\"image-link\"\r\n    rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"\r\n

too.\r\nWe had to wait about 20 minutes even though we moved early in the morning.\r\nThe early bird can eat Gogi Guksu.\r\n\r\n## Geum Oreum\r\n\r\n<div class=\"google-map\">\r\n  <a\r\n

over an hour to get there by bus and taxi.\r\n\r\nOreum is a Korean word for Monogenetic Volcano distributed throughout Jeju Island.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Geum Oreum is called small Hallasan or Baeknokdam is that after rain, a puddle forms like Baeknokdam.\r\nFor travelers to see this properly,\r\nit must be after the rain before they visit,\r\nand luckily we could see the puddle after the rain.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/posts/7/KakaoTalk_20220501_131246877_11.jpg \"Small Baeknokdam, Guem Oreum\")\r\n\r\nThe sky was also clear and wonderful while climbing Geum Oreum.\r\n\r\n<div

Coffee is a world-famous cafe,\r\nbut there are only two locations in Korea: Seoul and Jeju Island.\r\n\r\nActually, I visited Blue Bottle Coffee in Seoul a few years ago.\r\nAt the time, I wondered why people are so obsessed with Blue Bottle Coffee.\r\nAnd Blue Bottle Coffee Jeju, which I visited this time, was no different.\r\n\r\nThe reason I put this schedule in was to sit in a cozy cafe and enjoy the scenery.\r\nHowever, there were too many people in the cafe and there were not enough places to sit,\r\nand we had to wait in line to order drinks.\r\n\r\n![](/assets/images/posts/7/KakaoTalk_20220501_131629517_15.jpg \"Good tasted latte\")\r\n\r\nFortunately, I liked the latte art of the latte I ordered and it tasted good.\r\nIf there
